# Codex OAuth extensions

These extensions reuse a configured ChatGPT/Codex OAuth source. Backend access to
search, transcription and GPT-Live is separate from text-model access. An enabled
adapter is not evidence that a particular account is entitled to the endpoint.

## Text and hosted search

The provider implements incremental text, reasoning and function-call streams.
Chunks have `is_chunk=True`; the final response contains complete text, tools,
raw response and usage. Consumers must not append the final full text to chunks.

`oauth_web_search` accepts `disabled` (default), `cached`, or `live`.
`oauth_web_search_domains` optionally restricts domains. Function tools and custom
tools are merged; conflicting definitions fail before sending. Request-level
`tool_choice` is honored. Citations come from actual backend URL annotations;
raw hosted-tool output is preserved in `raw_completion`.

Plugins can override search and rate-limit behavior for one request without
changing shared provider configuration. The defaults preserve the provider and
agent behavior used before these fields were added:

- `oauth_web_search="inherit"` uses the provider configuration. `disabled`
  removes hosted search from both provider configuration and
  `custom_extra_body.tools`, while ordinary function tools remain available.
  `cached` and `live` select the corresponding hosted-search mode.
- `retry_rate_limits=False` disables only HTTP 429 retries. Connection failures
  and other retryable statuses keep the configured retry behavior.
- `fallback_on_rate_limit=False` stops the agent after a structured HTTP 429
  instead of trying a fallback provider.

Set the fields directly when returning a request from an event:

```python
yield event.request_llm(
    prompt="Answer with current information.",
    tool_set=tools,
    oauth_web_search="live",
    retry_rate_limits=False,
    fallback_on_rate_limit=False,
)
```

The same names are accepted by the two plugin SDK helpers:

```python
response = await context.llm_generate(
    chat_provider_id=provider_id,
    prompt="One model call",
    oauth_web_search="disabled",
    retry_rate_limits=False,
)

response = await context.tool_loop_agent(
    event=event,
    chat_provider_id=provider_id,
    prompt="Run tools if needed",
    tools=tools,
    oauth_web_search="disabled",
    retry_rate_limits=False,
    fallback_on_rate_limit=False,
)
```

These controls stay attached to every model call in the agent run, including
function-result rounds, schema repair calls and fallback providers. A 429 error
retains `status_code=429` on the final `LLMResponse` when fallback is disabled.

## Read-only quota query

Quota configuration is intentionally hidden from general AI settings and other
provider pages. It selects a Codex OAuth source (account), never a chat model.
With one enabled built-in Codex OAuth source, the source is selected automatically,
even when no chat model has been added for it. With multiple sources, set the
source ID explicitly in the active profile's configuration:

```json
{
  "provider_settings": {
    "codex_oauth_usage": {
      "enabled": true,
      "source_id": "openai_oauth"
    }
  }
}
```

An empty `source_id` uses automatic selection only when the source is unambiguous.
`enabled: false` disables quota queries for the profile. Existing `provider_id`
settings are supported by resolving the saved model's exact `provider_source_id`;
new configuration should use `source_id`. The calling chat model is never used
as an account fallback. Quota reads use source credentials and network settings
without invoking a model or refreshing credentials.

The built-in `/codex_oauth_usage` command and `codex_oauth_usage` LLM tool
read the configured Codex OAuth account's usage. An administrator in the
current configuration profile can use them in private chats or any group;
ordinary members cannot query the account. Authorization requires both the
event's administrator role and its sender ID in the current profile's
`admins_id` list, checked again after provider lookup and after the usage
request. The legacy
`group_allowlist` value is retained in existing configuration files but no
longer controls this quota query. These rules do not change image generation
or editing permissions.

## Experimental image generation and editing model request

The ChatGPT/Codex OAuth source has an optional, experimental `oauth_image_model` setting.
It sends a model request in the `image_generation` tool and does not change the
main `model` used for the Responses request. An empty setting leaves the tool
model unset, preserving the previous request. Accepted request values are
`gpt-image-2`, `gpt-image-2.5-flare`, and `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`.

Plugins calling the provider can override the source setting for one image
request. Passing an empty string explicitly restores backend selection for
that request. The same selection applies to HTTP and WebSocket requests and
to both generation and reference-image editing.

```python
images = await provider.generate_image(
    "Illustrate a mountain at sunrise",
    model="gpt-6-sol",
    image_model="gpt-image-2.5-flare",
)
```

An unsupported nonempty image model fails before sending the request. Existing
calls without the new argument keep the previous payload when the source
setting is empty. The backend may ignore the requested image model or fall
back, and a successful image response does not confirm which model was used.
Availability depends on the account's backend permissions.

## Ordinary voice messages

Existing AstrBot STT and TTS providers remain usable with the Codex text model.
The optional `openai_oauth_stt` adapter references an existing source using
`oauth_source_id`. It shares refresh state and follows source updates and removal.
The adapter is disabled by default because the transcription endpoint may require
separate account credits. No API-key fallback occurs.

To transcribe attachments passed directly to an OAuth chat provider, opt in using
`oauth_audio_transcription: true`, with optional
`oauth_transcription_model: gpt-4o-transcribe`. Transcription failures propagate;
audio is never silently discarded. Plugins can explicitly call
`await provider.transcribe_audio(audio_url, model="gpt-4o-transcribe")`.

This extension does not claim OAuth access to ordinary `/audio/speech` synthesis.
Use an existing AstrBot TTS provider for ordinary synthesized voice replies.

## Plugin realtime entry

The plugin owns its WebRTC peer connection, microphone input and playback. AstrBot
brokers an SDP offer and keeps a sideband control connection. Credentials remain
on the server. No Dashboard route, UI, or raw PCM transport is added.

Use an OAuth provider obtained with `context.get_provider_by_id(provider_id)`.
Create a realtime session from the plugin's SDP offer, apply the returned answer
to that peer connection, consume session events and close the session when the
plugin unloads or the peer disconnects. The implementation also bounds lifetime,
idle time, event queues and concurrent pending/active sessions. Text-model names
such as `gpt-6-astra` are not realtime model names.

The protocol uses OAuth `realtime/calls?intent=quicksilver&architecture=avas`
and a fixed GPT-Live sideband endpoint. Tool work uses client delegation events,
not an advertised native function schema. Plugins decide how to execute a
delegation and return its result. A failed creation whose response is lost cannot
prove remote cleanup; no unverified HTTP hangup endpoint is substituted.

```python
provider = context.get_provider_by_id("openai_oauth/gpt-6-astra")
session = await provider.create_realtime_session(
    offer_sdp,
    voice="cove",
    instructions="Respond briefly.",
)
async with session:
    await peer.set_remote_answer(session.answer_sdp)  # Implement in the plugin.
    async for event in session.events():
        if event.type == "delegation":
            result = await handle_plugin_delegation(event.text)
            await session.submit_delegation_result(event.delegation_id, result)
        elif event.type in {"input_transcript", "output_transcript", "turn_done"}:
            await handle_plugin_transcript(event)
```

The peer and delegation handlers above are plugin-owned examples. Never send
OAuth tokens to the peer. Close the session and peer together when either fails.
`session.send_text()` and delegation results use `speakable` or `commentary`
channels; `session.touch()` can report active media when sideband transcripts are
temporarily absent. Ping traffic does not reset the idle timer.

Transcription and realtime remain explicit opt-ins. Search and rate-limit fields
do not activate either feature, and neither feature falls back to an API key.

End-to-end voice acceptance requires a real plugin WebRTC peer and audio input
and output. Unit tests, SDP negotiation and sideband readiness each establish
only their corresponding layer.
